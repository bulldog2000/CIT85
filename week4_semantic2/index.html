        <h2>How and What Food Can Change Your Mood</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h3>The principle of pleasure</h3>
        <p>Food is one of the pleasures of life, and if possible we would prefer to eat foods we enjoy and avoid those we do not like. Proven research has shown that the consumption of our favourite foods can trigger the release of b-Endorphin, a substance that is known to improve our mood.</p>
        <p>However to gain the most pleasure from the food we like there are other factors that are taken into account like: how hungry we are, our previous experience from the consumption of that particular food and the social environment in which it is consumed. In other words, the right type of food, the right time with the right people is what will make us feel good and eventually change our mood.</p>

        <h3>Strong desire for food</h3>
        <p>The strong desire for a specific type of food, or else the urge to eat certain foods appears to be very common. 60% to 90% of people indicate a strong desire to eat some specific types of food. It is interesting that men and women link different attitudes and feelings in this intense desire.</p>
        <p>Men usually interpret the strong desire for food as motivated by hunger, while women are more likely to associate food with negative mood, boredom and anxiety. Women are also more likely to show negative emotions such as guilt and regret after the consumption of food they really enjoy.</p>
